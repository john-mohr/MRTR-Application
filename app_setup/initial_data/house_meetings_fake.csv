Blake. Ask questions regarding hire on package & set expectations for himself and employer

Chris. Find a meeting in Magna

Eric. Go to more meetings

Jordan. Help cousin Krista

Brandon. Save $200

This meeting was full of emotion. Mostly caused by Jordan and Eric walking out in the middle of Chris sharing. The argument was made by Eric that Chris is not respecting everyone's time as a whole by rambling on with a similar story every week. The agreement was made to Eric that, the meeting is an hour long and what we do in that hour matters. Also, that it is disrespectful to walk out on others while sharing when everyone respects him enough to stay and listen to Eric sharing.

Tension was high, but Dustin was able to keep the room at a consistent ""temperature"" without things getting out of hand."|7|1|2023-08-13 12:00:00

2601|Sep 19, 2023|Jared|James|Text|James missed the meeting last night because of work, so he didn't get his chore done, or clean his room. I told him no problem, please get it done when you get home from work. He promised me he would take care of it when he got home last night. He didn't do either. When I got up this morning for work, I asked him again to get it taken care of. I just got home, and nothing has been done. I sent James a text asking why, and he said he was in a hurry. I let him know that poor time management is not a good reason. He didn't leave here until noon today. When I pointed that out to him, and said he should have got it done before he had to leave, he said he didn't do it because he was exhausted. Again, not a good reason. The way I see it is James just does whatever he wants to, and when he gets called out on his behavior; he offers up an excuse and expects all to be forgiven. This is a reoccurring pattern in many different facets of his life. Continuing to cater to this behavior is not beneficial. I am putting James on a behavioral contract, and assigning him an extra duty around the house as a consequence for his behavior. Please contact me with your thoughts. |2023-08-13 12:00:00

2802|Sep 16, 2023|Jared|James|Text|I have some concerns about James. He stayed out last night, and didn't let anyone know. He is still smoking marijuana, which means he won't be getting his adhd medication. Amazon told him he can't start work until he has that medication, so I highly doubt he will be starting work on the 21st. He has not paid all his rent yet, but he is spending money on vapes, weed, and just had a package delivered to the house. He hasn't been doing day labor to try to catch up on rent. I understand that you have been giving him a great deal of leeway, but I think the time for that needs to be over. He is not going to change his behavior if there arw never any consequences to for his actions. I think at this point it is doing him a disservice. In order to grow, he needs to be treated like everyone else. Also, allowing him to constantly be extremely late on rent sets a bad example for the other residents of the house. With all the new people coming in, I don't want them to think it's ok to constantly be late on rent. James has been in the house for at least 6 months. It's time to start treating him like an adult. |2023-08-13 12:00:00

3018|Feb 8, 2023|Tracy Dehaas|Laura wantanabe|Text|"Hi Tracy. I hope you're doing well. I'm still in the hospital. 
I'll preface this by apologizing for the long text. I don't have access to my phone for very long. 
My aunt is going to come get my car (so it doesn't get towed). It's parked a few houses down on the street. 

I'm not going to be coming back to house. I think I need more than what sober living is meant for. The hospital is trying to help me find a place to go. They got me setup with a mental health outreach team that will meet with me, manage medication and help me on the road to being a functioning person again. 

I'm sorry, I'm sad I won't be living with you guys anymore. 

I was wondering when you'll be around and available so my aunt can grab my things that you packed.  
(There's some food items in the cupboard I shared with Erin as well as a coffee cup, plate and some drinks/tea in the top left cupboard if you're facing the sink), can you throw those things in a couple grocery bags for me please?
I'll be able to check my phone tomorrow and hopefully have enough time to get things arranged with you.

Thank you for all your support. You've been a bright light in the house. I really do appreciate you being so kind and understanding. You were the best house manager I could've hoped for. I just wanted to let you know that...and say thank you for everything. "|2023-08-13 12:00:00

5171|Aug 17, 2023|Jared|Eric |Text|Eric seems to be struggling. He is upset with me for asking him to comply with the rules of the house. After asking him multiple times throughout the day yesterday to do his dishes, he washed a couple and then left the house. I sent him a text asking why he didn't do them all. He lied to me and said he did. When he got back home I asked him again to please wash his dishes. He finally did, and said it would no longer be a problem. This morning when I got up for work, he had once again left dishes in the sink from the night before when he was cooking dinner. He also left garbage, and personal items on the coffee table over night. I sent him a text letting him know this was unacceptable. He told me to chill out, and he would get to them later. This has been going on for a month. I am not going to continue to have this discussion with him in a daily basis. I recommend that he be put on a behavioral contract, as all other methods of motivation to correct this behavior have failed. |2023-08-13 12:00:00

5343|Aug 22, 2023|Jared |Eric|In person|Eric continues to be disrespectful, and dismissive of the house rules. He failed a drug test last night. I gave him the opportunity to retest just in case it was a false positive, and he has been giving me the runaround all day. It's now 8:15 at night, and he keeps avoiding me, and giving me excuses why he can't take a test right now. I do not want him in the house any longer. He is disruptive, and I believe his behavior is a danger to the other members of the house. Brian agrees with me in this regard. |2023-08-13 12:00:00
